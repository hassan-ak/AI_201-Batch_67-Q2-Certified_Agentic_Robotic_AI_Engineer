# Assignment 06: Build an OpenAI Agent SDK-Based Chatbot with Chainlit

## üéØ Objective

Develop a **smart, multi-tool chatbot** using the **OpenAI Agent SDK** integrated with **Chainlit**. The chatbot should support **streaming responses**, manage **complete chat history**, and integrate **two or more tools**‚Äîone of which must invoke an **external API**, and another must be an **agent tool**. You will also use **Chainlit chat profiles** to provide users with customization options, such as model selection or other functionality.
