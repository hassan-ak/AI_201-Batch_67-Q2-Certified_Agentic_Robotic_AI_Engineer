# Assignment 01: Create a Message Formatter Python Script with Decorators

## Objective

Write a Python script that formats text messages with custom decorations (e.g., borders, emojis, or patterns) using Python decorators. Each student will design unique decorators to personalize their message formatting, ensuring every solution is distinct.

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with creating a Python script that formats text messages in a fun and creative way. The script must include at least **two custom decorators** that you design to add visual flair to messages (e.g., surrounding the message with stars, adding emojis, or creating a boxed effect). The script should be easy to run and demonstrate the use of your decorators.

## Why It's Exciting

- **Creativity:** Design your own unique text decorations (e.g., a heart border, a spooky Halloween theme, or a futuristic cyber style).

- **Fun with Decorators:** Experiment with Python decorators to transform plain messages into visually appealing outputs.

- **Showcase Your Style:** Create a project that reflects your personality through unique designs.

## Requirements

1. **Project Structure:**

   - Create a Package using UV package manager
   - In your package create a file message_formatter.py to implement the two decorator functions.
   - Create a Python script named main.py for a demonstration of the usage of the implemented decorators.

2. **Decorators:**

   - Implement at least **two custom decorators** that add unique formatting to messages.
   - Each decorator should modify the output of a function that returns or prints a string message.
   - Examples of decorations:
     - Add a border of asterisks (**\***) around the message.
     - Add emojis (e.g., ðŸŽ‰) before and after the message.
     - Create a themed border (e.g., ~â™¥~ for a heart theme).
   - Ensure your decorators are unique to your personal style or theme (e.g., a sports theme, a nature theme).

3. **Functionality:**

   - Write at least one function that takes a message (string) as input and returns or prints it.
   - Apply your decorators to this function to demonstrate their effect.
   - Example:
     ```py
     print(greet("Hello, World!"))
     ```
   - Possible output:
     ```
     ************
     ðŸŽ‰ Hello, World! ðŸŽ‰
     ************
     ```

4. **Uniqueness:**

   - Choose a theme or style for your decorators that reflects your personality or interests (e.g., a superhero theme, a music theme).
   - No two students should have the same decorator designs. Be creative!

5. **Documentation:**

   - Include a README.md file explaining how to run your script.
   - The README.md must include a screenshot of the terminal showing the output of your decorated messages.
   - Add comments in your code to explain how your decorators work.

6. **Submission:**
   - Create a GitHub repository for your project.
   - Push your project code
   - Submit the link to your GitHub repository as your assignment submission.
   - Ensure the repository is public or accessible to the instructor.

## Note

The assignment submission **deadline** is **2025-04-26** at **11:59 PM**. Once the submission date has passed, no new assignments will be accepted under any circumstances.
