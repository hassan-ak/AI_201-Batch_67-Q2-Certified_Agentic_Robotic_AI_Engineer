| **Library**                        | A set of pre-made tools or code that helps you do common tasks more easily.       | Like a **calculator** ‚Äì you use it to save time doing math.                      | You **import** it and use its functions in your code when you need them. | NumPy (Python), jQuery (JavaScript) |
| **Framework**                      | A bigger structure or system that helps you build apps faster and more organized. | Like a **house blueprint** ‚Äì you build your home inside a ready-made structure.  | You **follow its rules**, add your code inside it, and it runs the app.  | Django (Python), React, Laravel     |
| **SDK (Software Development Kit)** | A full package of tools to help you build apps for a specific platform.           | Like a **DIY furniture kit** ‚Äì it gives you everything to build a specific item. | It comes with libraries, tools, and guides to help you build apps.       | Android SDK, iOS SDK, .NET SDK      |

### Building a Weather App

| Part                   | What It Did                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Python (Language)**  | Wrote the logic, connected everything.     |
| **Requests (Library)** | Helped you talk to websites easily.        |
| **Flask (Framework)**  | Turned your app into a web app.            |
| **Weather API SDK**    | Gave a shortcut to use their weather data. |

## AI, GenAI and AI Agents

| **Concept**                      | **Description**                                                                                                            | **Example**                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI (Artificial Intelligence)** | AI is when computers or machines are made to think and make decisions like humans.                                         | Your phone suggesting words while typing.                                         |
| **GenAI (Generative AI)**        | GenAI is a special type of AI that can _create_ new things like text, images, music, or code.                              | ChatGPT writing essays, stories, or answering questions.                          |
| **AI Agents**                    | AI agents are smart programs that can _act_ on their own to do tasks. They use AI to make decisions and work step-by-step. | A helper robot that plans, searches the web, and provides summaries autonomously. |

## What is an API?

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

Think of it as a **waiter** in a restaurant.

- You (the user) sit at a table and look at the **menu**.
- You don‚Äôt go into the kitchen and make your own food.
- Instead, the **waiter** takes your order to the kitchen and brings your food back to you.

‚û°Ô∏è In the same way, an **API** is a messenger that lets different software programs talk to each other.

### Real Life example of API

Imagine you‚Äôre using a **weather app** on your phone.

- That app doesn‚Äôt have all the weather data inside it.
- It sends a **request** to a weather service **API** (like asking the kitchen for food).
- The weather service sends back the **data** (the food).
- The app then shows you today‚Äôs temperature.

### üß† In Simple Words:

An **API** lets one app or website **ask** another app or website for **information** or **services**.

- It‚Äôs like a **bridge** between two programs.
- You don‚Äôt need to know how the other program works, you just use the API.
